# PhotoStructure coding skills

A dual [Codex](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins) and
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) plugin marketplace for disciplined
planning, proof-based review, focused Git history, web and Electron security,
modern C++ native development, and maintainable Rust projects. Every skill is
packaged natively for both products.

The `coding` plugin contains general engineering workflows, including a
plain-language editing pass for technical prose. The `security`
plugin pairs proof-gated JavaScript/TypeScript web and Electron vulnerability review
with applicability-aware OWASP ASVS and Electron Security Checklist hardening
assessments. The `cpp` plugin provides
the corresponding defect-review and build-hardening pair for modern C++ and
Node.js native addons. The `rust` plugin sets up or assesses idiomatic safe Rust
projects, including Cargo policy, strict usable linting, testing, CI, packaging,
and publishing preparation.

## Skills

| Plugin | Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| coding | `write-clearly` | Clarify prose and make agent instructions unambiguous without changing meaning or voice. |
| coding | `replan` | Iteratively critique alternatives before settling a complex design. |
| coding | `review` | Review code and report only issues proven through the full code path. |
| coding | `review-staged` | Apply the same proof gate to the staged diff before proposing a commit. |
| coding | `second-opinion` | Get a cross-model review, then accept or veto every finding with evidence. |
| coding | `gitplan` | Untangle a mixed working tree into coherent Conventional Commits. |
| coding | `stage` | Stage only the hunks attributable to the current body of work. |
| coding | `tpp` | Continue the current phase of a living Technical Project Plan (TPP). |
| coding | `handoff` | Update the active TPP so a later session can continue without rediscovery. |
| coding | `tpp-orchestrate` | Drive a queue of TPPs through TDD, independent review gates, and coherent commits. |
| security | `web-security-review` | Trace JavaScript/TypeScript web and Electron data flow and report only proven vulnerabilities. |
| security | `web-security-hardening` | Assess applicable web and Electron preventive controls against ASVS- and Electron-guided baselines. |
| cpp | `resource-review` | Prove native memory/resource defects through traces, reproducers, or complete lifetime analysis. |
| cpp | `project-setup` | Assess cross-platform build hardening, analysis tooling, CI, and modern C++ conventions. |
| rust | `project-setup` | Set up or assess idiomatic safe Rust, strict linting, maintainability, CI, packaging, and publishing readiness. |

The workflows are documented in depth at

## Install in Codex

Add this GitHub repository as a marketplace, then install any plugins you want:

```shell
codex plugin marketplace add photostructure/coding-skills
codex plugin add coding@photostructure
codex plugin add security@photostructure
codex plugin add cpp@photostructure
codex plugin add rust@photostructure
```

Enter `/plugins` in the Codex CLI to browse configured marketplaces and manage
plugins. Start a new task after installation so Codex discovers the bundled
skills.

Type `$` in a prompt to select a skill explicitly. Installed plugin skills are
namespaced by plugin, for example:

```text
$coding:replan
$coding:review
$coding:stage
$coding:write-clearly
$security:web-security-review
$security:web-security-hardening
$cpp:resource-review
$cpp:project-setup
$rust:project-setup
```

Codex can also invoke a skill implicitly when the request matches its
description.

### Test locally in Codex

Use a disposable, empty directory as `CODEX_HOME` so development installs do
not affect your normal Codex configuration. Set that environment variable using
your shell's normal syntax, then run:

```shell
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/coding-skills
codex plugin list
codex plugin add coding@photostructure
codex plugin add security@photostructure
codex plugin add cpp@photostructure
codex plugin add rust@photostructure
codex plugin list
```

Confirm the versions reported by `codex plugin list` match each plugin's
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, then start a fresh Codex task under the same
disposable `CODEX_HOME` and verify the `$` skill picker lists every skill in the
table above. Remove only that disposable directory when finished.

## Install in Claude Code

The original Claude Code marketplace and manifests remain supported:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add photostructure/coding-skills
/plugin install coding@photostructure
/plugin install security@photostructure
/plugin install cpp@photostructure
/plugin install rust@photostructure
```

Invoke Claude Code skills with their plugin namespace:

```text
/coding:replan
/coding:review
/coding:gitplan
/coding:write-clearly
/security:web-security-review
/security:web-security-hardening
/cpp:resource-review
/cpp:project-setup
/rust:project-setup
```

### Test locally in Claude Code

Point Claude Code at the repository root instead of the GitHub shorthand:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/coding-skills
/plugin install coding@photostructure
/plugin install security@photostructure
/plugin install cpp@photostructure
/plugin install rust@photostructure
```

Start a new task after installing or updating a plugin before testing its
skills.

The `gitplan` and `stage` skills teach an agent to curate the index. For the
same discipline by hand, [photostructure/git-tools](https://github.com/photostructure/git-tools)
has `git addgrep`, `git restage`, and `git post-fmt` as plain shell scripts for
your `$PATH`.

## Validation

Run the repository validator from the root:

```shell
python3 scripts/validate_repository.py
```

Before publishing, also run the current Codex `$skill-creator` validator for
every skill, the `$plugin-creator` validator for every plugin, parse both
marketplace JSON files, check relative Markdown links, and run
`git diff --check`. Test both marketplace installations in fresh tasks.

Review orchestration is bounded on both hosts. Claude Code uses each
review-capable plugin's tool-restricted `reviewer` agent, which has neither the
`Agent` nor `Skill` tool. Codex and other hosts use the same non-triggerable leaf
methodology through a `delegation-budget: 0` prompt contract and task-local
context. Review skills keep a leaf-mode guard so an implicit skill match cannot
restart orchestration. Setup-only plugins do not invent reviewer agents.

`second-opinion` is the deliberate exception to the host-neutral rule: its whole
job is to shell out to the *other* vendor's CLI (plain `codex exec` with a
`$coding:review` prompt from Claude Code, `claude -p` with a `/coding:review`
prompt from Codex), so it names both hosts. The validator allows those exact
review invocations in that one file and applies every other portability rule to
it. It falls back to a same-model reviewer, and says so, when the other CLI is
missing or unauthenticated.

## Adapting the workflows

The skills are intentionally generic. Prefer durable project instructions in
`AGENTS.md`; also honor `CLAUDE.md` when a repository uses it for Claude Code
compatibility. Each skill's adaptation section identifies the project-specific
invariants, references, or review checks worth adding.

## Versioning and marketplace updates

Every native `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` uses strict Semantic Versioning. The
initial native release is `1.0.0`. Bump the patch version for compatible fixes,
the minor version for backward-compatible capability additions, and the major
version for breaking workflow or packaging changes.

The marketplace catalog has no version field. The unqualified
`photostructure/coding-skills` source follows the repository's default branch
when Codex adds or upgrades the marketplace snapshot. A plugin's manifest
version identifies the installed cache entry; it does not pin the marketplace
repository. Bump that version whenever published plugin content changes so the
cached copy has a distinct identity.

For a reproducible marketplace snapshot, pin a Git tag, commit, or branch with
`owner/repo@ref` or `codex plugin marketplace add owner/repo --ref <ref>`.
Repository tags are release bookkeeping unless the marketplace source is
explicitly pinned to one.

During unpublished local iteration, follow the current `$plugin-creator`
cachebuster/reinstall workflow. Use stable SemVer values for published plugin
content rather than treating every commit on the tracked branch as a release.
