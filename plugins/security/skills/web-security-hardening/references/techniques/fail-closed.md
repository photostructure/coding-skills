# Fail Closed on Exceptional Conditions

Authentication and authorization failures must not fall through to a protected action.
For ancillary controls, define a secure degradation policy that also considers availability.

## Fail-open shapes to grep for

Every security decision has an error path; the review question is where that path ends up.

- Auth/authz middleware whose `catch` (or validation-miss branch) calls `next()` with no
  argument, `return next()`, or drops through to the handler. Grep middleware for
  `catch` blocks that reach `next()` instead of `next(err)`, `res.status(401/403)`, or a
  thrown error. Fix: the branch must not invoke the protected handler. Return `401` for
  missing/invalid authentication, `403` for an understood but disallowed request, or a
  generic `5xx` when the security service failed; do not mislabel an outage as bad credentials.
- A JWT / webhook-signature / HMAC verify wrapped in `try/catch` that returns a truthy or
  default value on failure — `catch { return true }`, `catch { return decoded ?? {} }`,
  `catch { return user }`, or `.verify(...).catch(() => defaultClaims)`. Fix: verification
  is boolean-or-throw; the `catch` re-throws or returns `false`/denies, never a permissive
  default. Use the library's throwing verify (e.g. `jwt.verify`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
  for signatures) and let the error propagate — verify the throwing-vs-returning contract
  against the installed library version.
- Unhandled promise rejection in async middleware that misses the intended error path. Grep for
  `async` route/guard handlers with no surrounding rejection capture, `.then()` without
  `.catch()`, and `await` on a verify call that is not inside the deny-on-throw path. A
  rejected promise that is never routed to the error handler can hang the request or reach
  process-level rejection handling; it does not inherently authorize the request. Fix:
  ensure async guards are wrapped so rejections reach the framework error
  handler (Express 5 forwards async rejections; Express 4 needs an async wrapper — confirm
  the installed major) and that the error handler denies rather than falling through.

## Dependency-outage fail-open

A control that consults an external system inherits that system's availability as a
security property.

- Rate limiter backed by Redis/Memcached that silently allows unlimited traffic on store
  failure. Choose the outage policy from the endpoint's abuse and availability risk:
  deny/defer expensive or authentication-sensitive operations, or fall back to a bounded
  local/edge limit. A universal “block everything” policy can turn the limiter dependency
  into an availability kill switch. Verify and test the installed library's store-error path.
- Auth provider / OIDC / token-introspection / policy-store (OPA, feature-flag, entitlement
  service) outage where the guard treats "cannot reach the decision point" as allow. Grep
  for `catch`/timeout branches around introspection, JWKS fetch, or policy evaluation that
  return `allow`, `true`, or a cached-permissive default. Fix: an unreachable authorizer is
  not an implicit allow. Use cached decisions only under an explicit bounded TTL/staleness
  policy whose integrity and revocation tradeoffs fit the authorization system.

## Fix: deny on any error in a security decision

- On an exception, timeout, or missing required input inside authentication or
  authorization, do not execute the protected action. Separate that invariant from the
  HTTP status and availability policy used for ancillary controls such as rate limiting.
- Verification functions raise (or return an explicit `false`) — they never return a
  permissive default, a partially populated identity, or an empty-but-truthy object.
- Logging or alerting a control failure is NOT failing closed. An observed-and-logged
  bypass is still a bypass. Log the failure AND deny in the same path.
- Prefer propagating the error to the framework error boundary over local `try/catch`
  recovery; do not "recover" a security decision part way through. See the auth/session
  guidance in [../identity-sessions-and-secrets.md](../identity-sessions-and-secrets.md)
  and the operational error-boundary guidance in
  [../deployment-and-operations.md](../deployment-and-operations.md).
